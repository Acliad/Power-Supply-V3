This project is for a constant voltage/constant current DC power supply designed by me. The project initially started as a way to learn more about electronics, and it served that purpose extremely well. There are many improvements that could be made, but those will probably never be realized as the next step in the Power Supply journey is a version 4 with a totally new architecture, much better mechanical design, an actually good ADC, and many more years of experience backing it.
